However, surveys need to record big samples of citizens per small area in order to allow reliable and precise direct estimates. Unfortunately, most available surveys are designed to be representative of large areas. In England, the Crime Survey for England and Wales suffers from small sample sizes at neighbourhood level. Even local surveys, which are used in criminology to measure crime patterns at lower geographical levels, are frequently based on samples that are not large enough to allow precise direct estimates at neighbourhood level.
In order to map variables recorded from victimisation surveys at small area level without need to record new data, indirect model-based small area estimation approaches are helpful to produce estimates of adequate precision. Small area estimation techniques make use of already existing survey data and introduce models to borrow strength from related and neighbouring areas. Model-based small area estimation techniques have shown to be a potential tool for low area level mapping in criminology.","This project will explore different small area estimation techniques and apply them to variables of primary interest for criminologists (e.g. worry about crime, perceived disorder, reporting crime). The research will make use of already existing data recorded from different social and victimisation surveys, such as the European Social Survey, the Crime Survey for England and Wales and the Manchester Resident Telephone Survey, and produce estimates from direct and indirect small area estimation techniques to provide highly precise estimates at small area level.",NA,NA,"53.4875235","-2.2901264"

Data were collected from a sample of young adults living in Southeast Queensland, Australia who completed momentary surveys on fear of crime (N = 499) that were administered on their mobile devices.  Results suggest that constructs contained in our proposed momentary model of victimisation worry fit the data appropriately and that associations between dimensions of victimisation worry are all statistically significant based on their expected directions (i.e., increased perceptions of victimisation risk in the immediate area significantly predicts increased momentary worry about crime).  We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of our findings, limitations of the current study, and direction for future research.","A commercial smartphone app was used to collect momentary fear of crime data from young adults.  The application was developed by MetricWire Inc (https://www.metricwire.com).   The  measures included in the survey were adapted from an established model of victimisation worry (see Jackson, 2005).  In this model, fear of crime consists of five empirically distinct dimensions of worry, likelihood, consequences, control and beliefs about crime.  Each dimension of fear proposed by Jackson, was adapted to the momentary context.  In addition to these measures, general measures of emotional state were added to the model to assess the relationship between positive/negative affectivity and place perceptions.  Participants were recruited using targeted social media advertisements on Facebook and Instagram.  Once participants enrolled in the study, the survey was triggered to their smartphone twice every 3 days, with a fixed 5-hour interval between pings.  Participants were instructed to respond to surveys for 3 months.","A journal article produced from this  project is currently under review.  Previous publications using mobile app technology:

We hypothesize that disorder-related posts on Twitter are associated with actual police crime rates. The digital revolution is generating high-volume data through multiple forms of online behaviour. The global adoption of social media over the past half a decade has seen the expansion of ‘digital publics’ to an unprecedented level. Estimates put social media membership at approximately 2.5 billion non-unique users, with Facebook, Google+ and Twitter accounting for over half of these. These online populations produce hundreds of petabytes (one billion megabytes) of information, with Facebook users alone uploading 500 terabytes (five hundred million megabytes) of data daily. We harvested a portion of this vast amount of data to interrogate the potential statistical link between social media updates (in this case tweets) that relate to crime, disorder and fear and official rates of crime as recorded by the police in all London boroughs. The study provides evidence that naturally occurring social media data provide an alternative information source on the crime and fear of crime problem.  
","Given the requirement to incorporate the temporal variability of police-recorded crime and Twitter data with the static regressors from the census, we used linear random- and fixed-effects regression. This meant that we could explore correlations between independent regressors including tweets that have high temporal granularity and variability and census regressors that have very low temporal granularity with the dependent measures of police-recorded crime. We took measurements at each consecutive month (variable for Twitter regressors and static for census regressors) within each borough (variable for both Twitter and census regressors). We were therefore able to conduct an ecological analysis of London police-recorded crime using Twitter data as a predictor. Random-effects (RE) assume that the boroughs error term is not correlated with the regressors, which allows for time-invariant variables to play a role as explanatory regressors (census measures). However, violation of this assumption renders RE inconsistent because of selection bias resulting from time-invariant unobservables. Fixed-effects (FE) models are based solely on within-borough variation, allowing for the elimination of potential sources of bias by controlling for stable (observed and unobserved) ecological characteristics. However, one side effect of FE models is that they cannot be used to investigate time-invari- ant causes of the dependent variables. We determined whether RE or FE was more appropriate using the Hausman test. Robust standard errors were used to account for heteroskedasticity.

Unfortunately, these existing strategies for reducing fear of crime have produced mixed results (see Chataway & Hart, 2017).  There are a number of possible reasons for why existing fear reduction strategies have produced mixed findings, for example, some interventions ignore how fear of crime may fluctuate across an individual's movements in place and time, thereby failing to target interventions for ""where"" and ""when"" people are most afraid about being victimised.  Recently, mobile technology has been used to examine the spatio-temporal patterns of fear of crime (Solymosi et al., 2015) and reliability of contemporary fear of crime measures (Chataway et al., 2017).  Initial findings from these pilot studies suggest that mobile technology can be used to collect reliable and accurate context-dependent information on fear of crime.  However, researchers are yet to explore whether mobile apps can be used as a first-stage intervention for reducing anxieties about crime.  Therefore, to provide local governments with the tools necessary to assess fear of crime accurately in the community and respond to it in a more effective manner, the current project aims to develop an innovative strategy to reduce worry about crime and disorder using mobile technology.  Specifically, the current project will use dynamic mobile triggers to implement different fear reduction strategies (i.e., text messages, voice recordings, imagery, and video) and test which approach(es) lead to a significant reduction in fear of crime and overall negative attitudes.","The current project is in the early development phase.  At present, the researchers are testing dynamic mobile triggers to determine their accuracy.

This work shows that in the absence of a general state law on prostitution, it is at the local level where the phenomenon is governed. It also shows how the governance of the phenomenon is not carried out in the same way for the whole city, but there is a disparity in each of the neighborhoods considered in this research. Finally, on the basis of the theoretical and methodological proposal, this work shows how street prostitution influences the perception of security differently depending on the neighborhood in which one resides.","I used qualitative methods and quantiative.
